I am currently a third year undergraduate student in Mathematics at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My interests are in Probability Theory, Stochastic Process, Statistical Inference.\rApart from academics, I am great foodie! I love to eat, and like to cook as well. I am also fan of Bengali Rock Music, but I am quite inclined to other genre as well. I also like to play First Person Shooter games, carrom, antichess, badminton, and cards. I am really fond of cardistry, and I also like to play literature, poker, auction bridge, contract bridge and call break.\rI also like to read in my free time, especially thriller and detective stories, but I am heavily biased towards Bengali Story Books. But if you have book suggestions for me, feel free to drop an email.
