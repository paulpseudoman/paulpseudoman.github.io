      <description>During the second semester, we had a course &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Statistics and Computation with data&amp;rdquo;. Our instructor Prof. Siva Athreya gave us a series of challenging questions to solve, each within a week. Although Most of it involved only coding, we had fun solving them (together!!)&#xA;Challenge 1: Link to heading Problem: A random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, can be thought of as a position of particle, at time $n$, denoted by $S_n$ which is defined inductively below.</description>
